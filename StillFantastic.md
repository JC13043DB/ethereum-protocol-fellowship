- [Verkle tree](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=a2vr0fOui4HL) 
  - To replace [Merkle-Patricia trie](https://app.tana.inc?nodeid=j_Gd5E4ODZM0) because proofs consumes too much bandwidth.
  - Branching factor k
    - O(kn) construction time
    - O(log_k(n))
  - Trade-off between computational power and bandwidth.
  - Proof is called witness.
