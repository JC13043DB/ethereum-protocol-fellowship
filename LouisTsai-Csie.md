## Notes

<!-- Content_START -->
### 2025.02.06
I finished the protocol wiki week0 and week1.
And this blog post from Vitalik: https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html
The wiki is awesome, it provide very useful resource to me.

### 2025.02.07
Today I learn the protocol overview and the protocol introduction in protocol wiki. I already know the protocol architecture contains the execution and consensus layer but do not know much about the details. I read the breakdown and gain more insight about Ethereum core!

### 2025.02.08
Read the week2 recording on the study group wiki and read the content regarding the execution layer. Complete the EL Specs part!
